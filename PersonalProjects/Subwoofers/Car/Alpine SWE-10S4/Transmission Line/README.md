Maximum excursion is 10mm for this driver. Excursion spike below about 30 Hz is not too worrysome
since the frequency response also rolls off heavily, but to be safe, a sub-sonic filter should be applied.

100 Hz spike would need to be tamed (either by setting a crossover lower than 80 Hz, via DSP, or equalizing it).
Ideal response after attempting to fix the spike would be a roll-off at 80 Hz in order to avoid being able
to hear subwoofer positioning.
